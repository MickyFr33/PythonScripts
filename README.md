# PythonScripts
I copied the main fucntion from the Threader 3000 (https://github.com/dievus/threader3000). I built a port scanner while trying to learn python but it was slow and I was pointed in the direction of threading to speed up the process. I stumbled upon the Threader 3000 as a reference to make my own variation. I have just tweaked a few things and made it a little more interactive and customizable. I smashed together a few fun things for practice and this is the results. Again the bulk inspriration came from the Threader 3000.
